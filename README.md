### Rust OS project

#### Getting started
The `run.sh` file in scripts is tailored for windows, as I'm building this on a windows machine; criminal I know, but 
it is what it is... 

As a windows user, providing qemu has been installed and added to your path, this should run seamlessly. 

#### Contributions
Happy to accept contributions (and/or improvements to existing source code). Create a PR, add your reasoning for changes or
additions, providing the code follows good practices... I'll accept the PR.
